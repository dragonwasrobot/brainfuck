# Brainfuck

This is an implementation of a basic brainfuck interpreter written in Elm.

## Commands

The brainfuck language consists of the following eight commands:

- `>` increments the data pointer
- `<` decrements the data pointer
- `+` increments the byte at the data pointer
- `-` decrements the byte at the data pointer
- `.` outputs the byte at the data pointer
- `,` prompts the user for a one byte input
- `[` jumps to the next `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero
- `]` jumps to the previous `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero
